# Accordion Component

The Accordion component is a flexible and accessible way to display collapsible content. It's perfect for FAQ sections, feature lists, and any content that benefits from organized, expandable sections.

## Overview

The Accordion component provides:
- **Multiple visual variants** to match different design contexts
- **Flexible sizing** for various layout requirements
- **Accessibility features** including ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- **Customizable content** supporting both text and React components
- **State management** with callback support for external state tracking

## Basic Usage

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

## Variants

The Accordion component supports three visual variants to match different design contexts:

### Default Variant
Clean and minimal with subtle border separators.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

### Bordered Variant
Each item has its own border and rounded corners for a card-like appearance.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Bordered} />

### Elevated Variant
Items have subtle shadows and background colors for prominent content sections.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Elevated} />

## Sizes

Choose from three size options to match your layout requirements:

### Small Size
Compact design for space-constrained layouts.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Small} />

### Medium Size
Default size with balanced spacing and typography.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Default} />

### Large Size
Spacious design for prominent content sections.

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Large} />

## Behavior Options

### Single vs Multiple Open Items

By default, only one item can be open at a time. You can enable multiple open items:

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.MultipleOpen} />

### Default Open Items

You can specify which items should be open by default:

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithDefaultOpen} />

## Advanced Features

### Custom React Content

The Accordion supports both string content and custom React components:

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.CustomContent} />

### Disabled Items

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.WithDisabledItems} />

## Real-World Examples

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.FAQStyle} />

### Feature List

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.FeatureList} />

## Accessibility

The Accordion component is built with accessibility in mind:

- **ARIA Support**: Full `aria-expanded` and `aria-disabled` attributes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Tab navigation and Enter/Space key support
- **Focus Management**: Proper focus indicators and ring styles
- **Screen Reader Support**: Semantic HTML structure and ARIA labels

## Best Practices

1. **Use descriptive titles** that clearly indicate what content will be revealed
2. **Keep content concise** - accordions work best with focused, digestible information
3. **Choose appropriate variants** based on your design context and content importance
4. **Consider user experience** - use `allowMultiple` when users might want to compare content
5. **Provide clear visual feedback** with hover and focus states
